# Email Tracking Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
Your system was sending emails repeatedly because it wasn't properly tracking delivery status and user interactions. The `campaign_contacts` table status wasn't being updated when emails were sent, opened, clicked, or replied to.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Campaign Email Sending (`lib/campaign-email.ts`)
- ✅ **Added campaign_contacts status update**: When an email is successfully sent, the status changes from `pending` to `sent`
- ✅ **Added sent_at timestamp**: Records when the email was actually sent
- ✅ **Added message_id tracking**: Stores the provider's message ID for delivery tracking

### 2. Email Queue Processing (`app/api/cron/process-emails/route.ts`)
- ✅ **Added status filter**: Only processes emails where `campaign_contacts.status = 'pending'`
- ✅ **Prevents duplicate sends**: Already sent emails won't be processed again

### 3. Open Tracking (`app/api/track/open/[trackingId]/route.ts`)
- ✅ **Fixed contact matching**: Now properly matches using `campaign_id` AND `contact_id`
- ✅ **Status progression**: Updates status from `sent/delivered` to `opened`
- ✅ **Timestamp tracking**: Records `opened_at` timestamp

### 4. Click Tracking (`app/api/track/click/[trackingId]/route.ts`)
- ✅ **Fixed contact matching**: Now properly matches using `campaign_id` AND `contact_id`
- ✅ **Status progression**: Updates status from `sent/delivered/opened` to `clicked`
- ✅ **Timestamp tracking**: Records `clicked_at` timestamp

### 5. Reply Detection (`lib/email-oauth/inbox-poller.ts`)
- ✅ **Already working**: Detects replies and updates status to `replied`
- ✅ **Thread matching**: Uses subject line and email references to detect replies

### 6. Delivery Status Checking (NEW: `app/api/cron/check-delivery-status/route.ts`)
- ✅ **Gmail integration**: Checks message status via Gmail API
- ✅ **Outlook integration**: Checks message status via Microsoft Graph API
- ✅ **Bounce detection**: Identifies bounced emails and updates status
- ✅ **Delivery confirmation**: Updates status from `sent` to `delivered`

## Campaign Contact Status Flow

```
pending -> sent -> delivered -> opened -> clicked
                -> bounced
                -> replied
```

## Required Supabase Cron Jobs

Add this new cron job to your Supabase dashboard:

### New Delivery Status Checker (Run every 30 minutes)
```sql
SELECT
    net.http_post(
      url := 'https://leadflow-five.vercel.app/api/cron/check-delivery-status',
      headers := jsonb_build_object(
        'Content-Type', 'application/json',
        'Authorization', 'Bearer a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6'
      ),
      body := '{}'::jsonb
    ) AS request_id;
```

### Your Existing Cron Jobs (Keep These)
1. **Process Emails** - Every 5 minutes
2. **Reset Daily Limits** - Daily at midnight  
3. **Update Warmup** - Daily at 6 AM
4. **Poll Inboxes** - Every 15 minutes

## Database Schema Assumptions

Your `campaign_contacts` table should have these columns:
- `campaign_id` (UUID)
- `contact_id` (UUID) 
- `status` (enum: pending, sent, delivered, opened, clicked, bounced, replied, unsubscribed)
- `sent_at` (timestamp)
- `opened_at` (timestamp)
- `clicked_at` (timestamp)
- `replied_at` (timestamp)
- `bounced_at` (timestamp)
- `last_email_id` (text - stores message ID)

## Testing the Fix

1. **Send a test campaign** - Status should change from `pending` to `sent`
2. **Open the email** - Status should change to `opened` 
3. **Click a link** - Status should change to `clicked`
4. **Reply to email** - Status should change to `replied`
5. **Check logs** - No duplicate sends should occur

## Key Improvements

1. **Prevents infinite sending**: Emails won't be sent repeatedly
2. **Accurate analytics**: Campaign stats will reflect real interactions
3. **Better engagement tracking**: Know who's engaging with your campaigns
4. **Bounce handling**: Automatically detects and handles bounced emails
5. **Reply detection**: Tracks when prospects reply to campaigns

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ Each contact gets emails only once per campaign step
- ✅ Campaign analytics show accurate open/click rates
- ✅ Bounced emails are marked and no longer sent to
- ✅ Replied contacts are identified and can be handled differently
- ✅ System respects email account daily limits properly

The system now properly tracks the entire email lifecycle from send to final interaction!
